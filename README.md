# CakePHP App: HoneyDo

I started building this app as my first MVC project, to learn the ropes, if you will. 
I find it common for people learning/teaching MVC to start off with simple projects like this, to wrap the student's head around MVC, and how things should be coded. I took that idea, and added a social aspect to it. 

#Here's the workflow:

1. User creates an account with a username, a password, a first name, and maybe their last name
2. User can create tasks for themselves, or can request a Honeyship with another user, possibly many, but I was more directing the initial project at spouses and partners. 
3. Honeyships enable one partner to assign To Dos to the other, like "Grab some milk while you're at the store."
4. Once a task is completed, the task is removed from the ToDo list view, and is only accessible on the Completed Task page.

#TODO as of last commit: 
1. Functionalize the Honey feature
	* establish relationships between users
	* ability to assign ToDos to honeys, and to self. 
2. Change password feature for users
3. Beautify UI

Possible future extensions:
- Mobile App API
- Multiple Honeyships
- Profile UI
- User search (for searching for specific Honeys)
